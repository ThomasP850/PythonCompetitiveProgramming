# Python Competitive Programming Solution Samples
This is a collection of some of my solutions to problems from the Baldwin Wallce University High School Programming Competition.

These problems were solved in **Python** and involve topics including:
- **Graph Theory**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Simulation**

Each solution is contained within its own directory, which includes a problem description, provided by the competition, and the solution file.
